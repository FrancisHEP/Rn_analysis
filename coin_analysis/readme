Three steps to analyze the evolution of thoron:
1. get ba212 tree from ana1 file
   gettree_ba212.C OR Th_Chain_BA.C
2. get counts of ba212 events from ba212 tree
   getcounts_ba212.C
3. plot the evolution of ba212 according to counts result and a well-prepared run-query table.
   plotevolution_ba212.C
   root -l 'plotevolution_ba212.C+("lst_files/2018_physical_lists/test_lists.txt")'
You can find files of interest in these directories:
...
coin_analysis/lst_files/2018_Kr_Rn_short.txt
coin_analysis/lst_files/2018_physical_lists/*
coin_analysis/plot_evolutions_ba212.sh

combine_roots.C	could combine two root files together
check_ba212.C	is a better version of CalRate_ba212.C
likelihoodnDim.C   is the FC method of interval estimation offered by Dan Zhang.

I could not remember the content of every codes. Especially these during 2018 annual meeting. 

I moved .lst files to directory text_files/
and once-only codes to directory talk_files/

echo:
root -l 'plotevolution_ba212.C+(lst_files/2018_physical_lists/2019Jan_stable_DM.txt)'
