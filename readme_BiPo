I feel very lucky that I have written a note about how to deal with perl scripts
and batch works during 2018 annual meeting period. Because I totally forget how
to use them now.

This is the readme for BiPo events.

1. Generate beta-alpha coincidence tree.
$ ./pl_condor_gen_batree.pl < Run13Rn_run.lst
where pl_condor_gen_batree.pl depends on process_gen_batree.sh
and   process_gen_batree.sh   depends on BiPo_coin.C
If you want to modify this procedure, you modify BiPo_coin.C
You can also run it for a single run, e.g.
$ root -l -q 'BiPo_coin.C(24467)'

2. Plot position of ba-coin events.
$ root -l 'ba_position_plot.C("/home/mawenbo/radonRun/Run13Rn_run.lst")'

These procedures should be repeated for these run lists:
Run11Rn_run.lst           Run13Rn_run.lst          
Run13Rn_run_HW_DEBUG.lst  Run13Rn_run_no_veto.lst
